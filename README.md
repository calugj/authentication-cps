## *Authentication of IoT Device and IoT Server Using Secure Vaults*

In the past years, we have seen a rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 
The fast growth poses a problem under a lot of aspects, from networking to authentication.
Ensuring that IoT devices can securely identify and communicate with each other is crucial, as they share a wide variety of personal information.
In this work, we will refer to the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8455985) to explore a three-way authentication protocol.
The authors have designed a multi key authentication mechanism, such that, even if the secret key (or a combination of keys) used for ongoing authentication is retrieved successfully by the attacker, the attacker cannot gain access to the unused authentication keys.
